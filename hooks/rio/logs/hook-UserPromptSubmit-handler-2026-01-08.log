Study specs/\\* to learn about the project specifications\n2. Review @fix_plan.md for current priorities\n3. Implement the highest priority item using best practices\n4. Use parallel subagents for complex tasks (max 100 concurrent)\n5. Run tests after each implementation\n6. Update documentation and fix_plan.md\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- ONE task per loop - focus on the most important thing\n- Search the codebase before assuming something isn't implemented\n- Use subagents for expensive operations (file searching, analysis)\n- Write comprehensive tests with clear documentation\n- Update @fix_plan.md with your learnings\n- Commit working changes with descriptive messages\n\n## 🧪 Testing Guidelines (CRITICAL)\n\n- LIMIT testing to ~20% of your total effort per loop\n- PRIORITIZE: Implementation > Documentation > Tests\n- Only write tests for NEW functionality you implement\n- Do NOT refactor existing tests unless broken\n- Do NOT add \"additional test coverage\" as busy work\n- Focus on CORE functionality first, comprehensive testing later\n\n## Execution Guidelines\n\n- Before making changes: search codebase using subagents\n- After implementation: run ESSENTIAL tests for the modified code only\n- If tests fail: fix them as part of your current work\n- Keep @AGENT.md updated with build/run instructions\n- Document the WHY behind tests and implementations\n- No placeholder implementations -
