# Overview Section

The foundation of your PRD. Define the problem space clearly.

## Problem Statement

Answer these questions:
- What pain exists today?
- What is the cost of not solving it?
- Why solve it now?

Format:
```
## Problem Statement

[Current state] causes [negative outcome] for [affected users].

Impact: [Quantified impact if possible]
```

## Target Users

Define who benefits:

```
## Target Users

### Primary: [User Type]
- Role: [What they do]
- Pain: [What frustrates them]
- Goal: [What they want to achieve]

### Secondary: [User Type]
- Role: [What they do]
- How affected: [Indirect benefit]
```

## Success Metrics

Measurable outcomes:

```
## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [When] |
| [Metric 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [When] |
```

Types of metrics:
- **Adoption** - % of users using feature
- **Performance** - Speed, latency improvements
- **Quality** - Error reduction, satisfaction
- **Business** - Revenue, conversion, retention

## Anti-Patterns

- "Make it better" (not measurable)
- "All users" (too broad)
- "ASAP" (not a timeline)
- Missing baseline (can't measure improvement)
