# 5C Framework

**C**ontext, **C**ontent, **C**onstraints, **C**riteria, **C**alls to action

Best for complex workflows with dependencies.

## Template

```xml
<context>
[Background information]
[Current state]
[Why now]
</context>

<content>
[Subject matter to work with]
[Input data or materials]
[Reference documents]
</content>

<constraints>
Hard (must not violate):
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

Soft (prefer but flexible):
- [Preference 1]
</constraints>

<criteria>
[How success is measured]
- [Criterion 1]: [How to evaluate]
- [Criterion 2]: [How to evaluate]
</criteria>

<calls_to_action>
[Specific steps, in order]
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Final deliverable]
</calls_to_action>
```

## Example

```xml
<context>
Q4 planning complete. 3 major features committed.
Need PRDs before sprint planning (2 weeks).
This is "Smart Search" feature - highest priority.
</context>

<content>
Input documents:
- @docs/features/smart-search-brief.md
- @research/search-interviews-q3.md
- @eng/smart-search-feasibility.md
- @strategy/competitor-search-features.md
</content>

<constraints>
Hard:
- Ship in Q1 (12 weeks)
- No ML infrastructure changes
- Sub-200ms response time

Soft:
- Prefer extending existing search
- Avoid features requiring user education
</constraints>

<criteria>
- Completeness: All PRD sections filled, no TBDs
- Clarity: Engineering can estimate without questions
- Feasibility: Tech approach validated
- User value: Connected to research insights
- Measurable: Trackable with current analytics
</criteria>

<calls_to_action>
1. Read all input documents, extract requirements
2. Draft PRD using @templates/prd-template.md
3. Identify 3 open questions for engineering
4. Create acceptance criteria per user story
5. Output: Complete PRD + questions list
</calls_to_action>
```

## When to Use

- Multi-step workflows
- Tasks with dependencies
- Complex projects with criteria
- Orchestrator agents
- Pipeline automation

## When NOT to Use

- Simple structured tasks → Use COSTAR
- Creative exploration → Use CRISPE
- Quick one-off tasks
